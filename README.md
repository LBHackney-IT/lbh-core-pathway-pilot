üö® **This is experimental BETA software. No guarantees of stability are made.** üö®

This is the codebase for the beta prototype being used for a pilot of the new core pathway for adult social care.

It expands on the form-building features of the [mainstream tool](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/lbh-social-care-frontend/wiki/How-to-create-and-modify-forms).

Users can:

- start, resume and complete workflows
- approve workflows on behalf of other users
- review and reassess workflows using a novel side-by-side interface

## üß± How it's built

It's a Next.js app backed by a PostgreSQL database, that interacts with:

- The [social care case viewer API](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/social-care-case-viewer-api/), in order to grab basic biographical information about the resident in question
- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), to provide a user-friendly way to define form flows and questions

It uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to speak to the database and [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) to handle Google login.

## üíª Getting started

### 1. Prerequisites

You need node, npm and at least one running PostgreSQL database.

You also need a [complete `.env` file](#-configuration).

### 2. Prepare databases

You can apply the schema to a fresh dev or test database with:

```
npm run db:push
```

### 3. Update `/etc/hosts` file

The Hackney authentication service requires the application to run on a `hackney.gov.uk` subdomain. To be able to access the application, add the following to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
# Hackney Social Care Frontend
127.0.0.1       dev.hackney.gov.uk
```
### 4. Running it

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app should then be on [dev.hackney.gov.uk:3000](http://dev.hackney.gov.uk:3000).

You need to have a Hackney Google account and be part of the one of the [allowed Google Groups](./config/allowedGroups.ts).

### 5. Import forms from Contentful (optional)

It expects form config to be defined in a data file `/config/forms/forms.json`.

You can edit this manually, but you can also import data from a correctly configured Contentful space using:

```
npm run import:contentful:forms
```

## üß™ Testing

You can run the Jest unit tests with `npm test`.

Check types with `npm run typecheck`.

Run eslint with `npm run lint`.

Run all the checks with:

```
npm run check
```

### Integration tests

To seed the database with the predictable test data (including login sessions) that Cypress needs, first run:

```
npm run seed
```

Then, spin up the app and open the Cypress UI:

```
npm run cypress
```

There are three Cypress specs:

- Browse, inspect and reassign workflows from the UI
- Beginning a brand new workflow (to do)
- Reviewing and reassessing a workflow (to do)

## üß¨ Configuration

It needs a few configuration variables to work.

You can supply these with a `.env` file. Run `cp .env.sample .env` to make a fresh one.

## üåç Deploying the application

It's suitable for anywhere you'd deploy a Next.js app, including Heroku, Vercel, Netlify and AWS.

[More in the Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).

### Deployment at Hackney

The application at hackney is supported by Hackney's [infrastructure repository](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/infrastructure/tree/master/projects/social-care-workflows)

### Form and other contents

Changes to form content (in contentful) results in the changes being pushed to an S3 bucket.
The application pulls form data from this bucket and if there are errors, it will fall back on the
locally stored files at `config/forms/forms.json`.
